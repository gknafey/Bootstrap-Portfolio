        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
                I am studying to become a full stack web developer. My goal is to obtain a job
               
                where I can work full time and remotely.  I participated in a Christian 
               
                leadership program for three years where I learned discipline, to lead, and 
               
                communicate effectively with all types of people. I also obtained a degree in 
               
                Environmental Business Economics from Rutgers University.  <br><br>
                
                After spending a significant amount of time in South America, I am almost fluent in Spanish.
               
                One day I would like to travel to more countries and return to visit South America. 
                
                I am very interested in VR and AR emerging technologies and plan to contribute to that

                industry if possible. Another one of my aspirations is to learn Japanese, and possibly 
                
                Italian.
